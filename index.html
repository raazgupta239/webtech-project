Natural henna creates a beautiful reddish/brownish stain on the body and has been used for thousands of years for therapeutic reasons, beautification, as well as rituals, rites of passage, and celebrations. 
                
                Bridal henna is one such practise that is beloved in many cultures and countries in the world. Intricate designs are applied to a bride's hands and feet before her wedding day and, historically it is said, the darker the stain the stronger the love between the husband and wife. 
                
                Therefore, traditionally throughout history, women have wanted get as deep a henna stain as possible. Not only is the color rich and exquisite when it is at its darkest, but the stain lasts a long time as well.</pre>
